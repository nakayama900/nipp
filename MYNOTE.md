## How to deploy to Firebase Hosting


Install the command line tool. 

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Log in to the Firebase.

```bash
firebase login
```

Initialize repo and create `.firebaserc`.

```bash
cd <this repo>
firebase init
```

Generated `firebaserc` should be like the following.

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "nipp-6a551"
  }
}
```

Deploy to Firebase.

```bash
firebase deploy
```
